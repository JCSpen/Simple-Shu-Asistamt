About the Application:

This application is a Console Based prototype of the Watson AI Interface to Education assigned to us by IBM. It utilises the Watson API, to generate appropriate responses using AI, in order to provide links to IBM's Skills Build Content. 

Further versions of this project will involve moving to a web application on .NET, meaning that this prototype will become obselete after this.

How to Run:

The application is not published, meaning you will have to run the code using an IDE/Run time environment. Visual Studio/Code is advised.
When using visual studio, open the file into the IDE, and use the solution to generate the program files.
If using alternative environments, only the program.cs file is needed, this can be copied also.
